# Lab Report 1

This is a tutorial showing how to log into a course specific account on ieng6.

## Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 

First, I went to the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) website and downloaded the version that correlated to my computer (i.e Windows, MacOS, Linux).

Once it was installed, I opened VS Code and my window looked like this:

VS Code might look different because it has various color schemes, styles, and themes.


## Step 2: Remotely Connecting

After I successfully downloaded VS Code, in order to connect remotely, since I am a Windows user, I downloaded [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) and followed the instructions on the linked attached.  

Once OpenSSH was successfully downloaded, I went back to VS Code and I opened a new terminal, which I did by going to the toolbar in VS Code and pressing terminal, then pressing new terminal (Refer to the picture below).

After I opened the new terminal, I typed in the following command: 

$ ssh cs15lsp22agx@ieng6.ucsd.edu

and then I logged in successfully my first time, it did not show me my password (which I was confused with at first), once I figured that out, it showed me my last login, my ip address, and I got a message that tells me Iâ€™m logged in and then my cluster status.

Note the "agx" part from above is unique to each student, so I went to the [Account Lookup Tool](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)  and l looked up my username.


## Step 3: Trying Some Commands

Once I was logged in, I ran the commands cd, ls -lat, ls-a, pwd, mkdir, and cp. Once I understood what each command did, I tried copying a file, hello.txt, from another cs15l22 account that was not mine using the cp command, but I got a permision denied message (refer to the picture below) because it was not my account.

## Step 4: Moving Files with scp

After running a few commands, I created a file called WhereAmI.java, to move it over to SSH. WhereAm.java looks like this:


class WhereAmI {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name"));
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
    }
}

Once this file was created I compiled it using javac and java, then ran the command "scp WhereAmI.java cs15lsp22agx@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/" which then asked me for my password again. Then I logged back into ssh and ran ls in which the file WhereAmI.java was listed in my home directory (refer to picture below).
